# 🎙️ Voice Scribe
Because calling it "Speechy McSpeechface" felt... wrong.

Voice Scribe is a Next.js app that turns your brilliant thoughts into readable text. Speak your mind — whether it’s your grocery list or your next big idea — and we’ll scribble it down for you.


### ✅ Built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui for clean, modern UI

### 🔐 Clerk for authentication (so your random thoughts stay yours)

### 🛢️ Supabase + Prisma for managing users & recordings

### 💳 Stripe to handle payments (because API credits aren’t free 😅)

## 🤖 OpenAI for accurate transcription


## 🎯 Features
#### 🎤 Record your voice directly in the browser
#### 📝 Instantly transcribe your speech to text
#### 🆓 First 2 recordings are free!
#### 💰 Starting from your 3rd recording, you’ll be prompted to pay (one-time payment via Stripe)
#### 🛡️ Secure authentication with Clerk
#### 📂 Recordings & transcripts are stored safely in Supabase

# 🚀 Running the Project
Haha, nice try.

You won’t be able to run this locally anyway — too many API keys, secrets and setups involved.

But hey, feel free to browse the code, steal some ideas, or open an issue if you're feeling fancy.

## 💳 Stripe Test Payment
When testing payments, use the classic test card:


Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242

Expiry Date: Any future date  
CVC: Any 3 digits  
ZIP: Any 5 digits  
(Yes, all 16 digits are 42. Stripe engineers have a sense of humor too.)
